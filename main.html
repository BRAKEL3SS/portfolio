        <h3>Below are some projects that I have worked on!</h3>
        <h4>NotRacn Website</h4>
        <p>A MERN-stack application that highlights the team that I race motocross on. I developed this Single Page Application from the ground up</p>
        <p>and look forward to making continual improvements over the life of the website</p>
        <a href="">Visit the page!</a>
        <h4>Twitter Watcher</h4>
        <p>A Python and Django based web application. This website consumes the Twitter API through use of Tweepy to display top trends from the US</p>
        <p>and displays tweets about those trends. Users are able to log in through Django authentication and preform full CRUD through comments on the tweets.</p>

        <h4>F1 Team Tracker</h4>
        <p>A full-CRUD Express web application built with Node.js and EJS. This website is used to track the teams that Formula 1 drivers currently race for.</p>
        <p>Users authenticate through Google OAuth and are ab;e to update the teams. This was the first full-stack application that I built</p>

        <h4>Blackjack!</h4>
        <p>A blackjack web-application build with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. The game works as player versus dealer with standard blackjack rules.</p>
        <p>The deck rebuilds and shuffles whenever it contains 7 or less cards at the end of a hand.</p>
